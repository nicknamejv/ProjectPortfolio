                                Hello, My name is Jon! Iâ€™m a Full Stack Developer and recent graduate from General Assembly with a background in the retail sector. Through this experience, I have created a strong foundation in communication, strategic thinking, and problem solving. I am highly devoted and passionate about CSS. I specialize in NEM stack (Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB) to create web applications with use of RESTFUL routing and full CRUD.

                                When I'm not coding you'll find me somewhere around the world. I love traveling and visiting national parks and so far I have visited all the major parks in the western United States. I also have a long list of hobbies that include photography, videography, and the occasional video game sessions.
